% Returns the position and orientation for the final frame based
% on algebraic calculations for each joint value.
%
% P is a 3 dimensional vector representing position in XYZ
% O is a 3 dimensional vector representing orientation in RPY
% q is a 6 dimensional vector that contains randomized values for testing.
% dhAlpha, dhA, dhD & dhTheta are 6 dimensional vectors that represent each
% column of the DH Parameters in use.
function [P, O] = forwardKinematicsAlg(q, thetas)

end

function [P, O] = getFinalFrame(q)
